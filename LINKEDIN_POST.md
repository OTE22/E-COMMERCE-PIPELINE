# 🚀 Just Launched: Production-Grade E-Commerce Analytics Platform

I'm excited to share my latest project—a comprehensive **Real-Time E-Commerce Analytics Platform** built to handle scale and deliver actionable insights. 📊✨

Designed with a focus on **Data Engineering** and **Modern Web Architecture**, this platform bridges the gap between raw data and business intelligence.

## 💡 Key Features
*   **Real-Time Dashboard**: Live tracking of Orders, Revenue, and Active Customers.
*   **Advanced Customer Insights**: Goes beyond basic reporting with automated **LTV & Churn Prediction**. Instantly identifies high-value VIPs and flags at-risk customers to prevent churn, turning raw data into actionable retention strategies.
*   **Smart Inventory**: Low-stock alerts and product performance metrics.
*   **Premium UX**: A fully responsive, dark-mode interface designed with modern glassmorphism aesthetics.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights
*   **Event-Driven**: Decoupled ingestion layer using Kafka consumers for reliability.
*   **Scalable**: Containerized microservices ready for orchestration.
*   **Secure**: PII masking, rate limiting, and security headers enabled by default.
